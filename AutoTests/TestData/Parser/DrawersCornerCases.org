#+DRAWERS: MyDrawers TestDrawer
#+EMPTY_PROPERTY: 

This Org file contains cases for drawer syntax that are cornercases
and need to be parsed correctly.

* headline_1
  :TestDrawer: Extra value after drawer title
  Note: This is a not drawer (the only test being OrgMode agreeing to
  it). If there is text after the drawer title :TESTDRAWER:, OrgMode
  does not fold it.
  :END:

* headline_2
  :TestDrawer:
  :TestValue: 1
  Note: This is a drawer, as verified by OrgMode detecting it.
  If there is text after the drawer closing line :END:, OrgMode does
  fold it.
  :END:      Extra value after drawer title
  But what is this piece of text called?

* headline_3
  :TestDrawer:
  Note: This is not a drawer, as verified by OrgMode not folding it,
  but it does highlight it.
** headline_3_1
  If the drawer entries contain a headline before :END:, OrgMode does
  not fold it.
  :END:
